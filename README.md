Here I have done a landing page of Online-Learning Platform. I have developed this landing page using HTML and CSS. The landing page begins with a clean and modern design. At the top, there is a navigation bar, followed by a catchy headline that conveys the platform's value proposition.
The Online learning platform landing page has several sections:
1.Header : It includes the navigation bar and the headline and tagline.
2.Services : It contains the services provided by the platform.
3.About : It describes the team.
4.Contact : It includes contact information.
